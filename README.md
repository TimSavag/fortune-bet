<h1>Fortune bet</h1>

<p><a href="https://bet2win.com.ng/bookmakers-review/fortune-bet/" target="_blank">Fortune bet</a>&nbsp;company is a well-known and reputable British bookmaker focused exclusively on the European market. The priority is great Britain, Germany, and Italy. Russia is on the list of banned countries. The bookmaker is incredibly popular in Europe, the company is a leader in the industry, and on all official Sky Sports TV channels it is possible to make bets even using the TV remote. It dates back to 1998. The head office is located in the UK.</p>

<h2>Official website of the bookmaker&#39;s office</h2>

<p>The site has an interesting history. For each country, the site is different and they only have a common color scheme. The bookmaker takes into account the specifics of the markets and offers different functionality for each localization.</p>

<p>For example, the site for the UK has a wide range of gambling, casinos, poker, and the like. But the Germans are deprived of such pleasure for some reason. Maybe there are problems with the law, or maybe there are just non-standard people living in Germany. To be honest, we don&#39;t know the reason for this.</p>

<p>There are also differences in the sports represented. For Italy, for example, the main thing is football and auto racing, so both the line and the painting for events in these sports are the most impressive. For the English, the emphasis is on horse racing and the same football. Therefore, if you are going to tell, then you need to do it about each resource. But it is impressive that the bookmaker is so attentive to its business and tries to take into account the needs of each specific target audience.</p>

<h2>How to register</h2>

<p>Not everyone can register on the site. Registration is officially allowed only for citizens of great Britain, Italy, Germany, Ireland, Austria, and Gibraltar.</p>

<p>And if you are lucky enough to have the citizenship of one of these countries, then you will not experience any difficulties with registration. The procedure is standard and simple. Answer a few typical questions &ndash; name, username, email, currency, and so on. In General, everything is like everyone else.</p>

<p>Full verification is required. Moreover, without it, it is impossible to even Deposit money to the account. Usually bookmakers simply do not allow you to withdraw funds without verification, but here everything is fair.</p>

<p>Theoretically, you can probably register for citizens of other countries, since when you select a country, there is a line &quot;Other countries&quot;. But where to enter Russia is completely unclear. We don&#39;t know of any cases where anyone has succeeded. If you have a burning desire to try it, then try it, but it will be even more difficult to withdraw your winnings later, and most likely it is simply impossible. After all, in this case, the company&#39;s rules will be violated.</p>

<h2>Access to the site&nbsp;</h2>

<p>To find the right site, you need to try. You can use anonymizers, but keep in mind that Fortune has its own resource for each country &ndash; do not confuse it!</p>

<p>Look for mobile versions in Google play &ndash; they are there and work on the territory of Russia. They don&#39;t differ from the main site in any way.</p>

<h2>Line and coefficients</h2>

<p>Odds, line and painting are not a competitive advantage of the Fortune bookmaker. They are the most that neither is on the middle. You can&#39;t say that the line is poor or the coefficients are low, but you can&#39;t say that the opposite is true. Everything is quite average.</p>

<p>The margin in the region of 5-6% on popular events, but not the most popular ones can soar to 12%. For events with an equal outcome, the coefficients range from 1.86 to 1.90.</p>

<p>The English were most lucky with the painting, and the German version of the site was the worst. In each market, as you have already understood, it is different. What remains unchanged is the functionality-filters and options for betting are quite convenient and &quot;made for people&quot;.</p>

<p>LIVE on Fortune is much poorer than pre-match. In the best case, top tournaments are presented, but there are no video broadcasts there either. Fortunately, there is a match center.</p>

<p>The loyalty policy is also different, depending on the region. For the British, the company offers free bets, for Italians, bonuses, and so on. But for some reason, the Germans were the most lucky here &ndash; they are offered a bonus of 500 Euros for the first Deposit to their account. Probably as compensation for the worst painting.</p>

<h2>Mobile betting</h2>

<p><br />
The Fortune mobile APP can be downloaded from Google play. The bookmaker has not yet developed an app for the IPhone. The site itself, of course, is also adapted for mobile devices. Moreover, automatic redirection to the mobile version occurs every time you log in from a smart device.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, neither mobile apps nor the mobile version are in any way inferior in functionality to the main version, and they consume much less traffic.</p>
